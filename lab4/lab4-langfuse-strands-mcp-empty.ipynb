    "# Evaluating Strands Agent with Observability with LangFuse\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this module, we'll explore how to implement observability for [Strands Agent](https://strandsagents.com/latest/) using [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/). Strands Agent enables you to build an intelligent AWS assistant by connecting foundation models to AWS services and resources, here's the link to [Strands Agent SDK's GitHub repo](https://github.com/strands-agents). While powerful AI agents can solve complex problems, understanding their behavior and performance requires robust observability solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Langfuse integration provides comprehensive visibility into your agent's operations, helping you monitor, debug, and optimize its performance. This module will guide you through implementing and leveraging Langfuse observability with Strands Agent to create more reliable, transparent, and effective AI solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you will learn from this module:\n",
    "1. Setup Lanfuse Observability \n",
    "2. Create a Strands Agent with [built-in tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/example-tools-package/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",
    "3. Create a Strands Agent with [custom tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/python-tools/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",
    "4. Lastly create a Strands Agent with [MCP tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/mcp-tools/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",

Discovery Workflow:\\n       - get_pricing_service_codes: Retrieve all available AWS service codes (starting point)\\n       - get_pricing_service_attributes: Get filterable attributes for a specific service\\n       - get_pricing_attribute_values: Get possible values for a specific attribute\\n       - get_pricing: Get actual pricing data with optional filters\\n       - get_price_list_urls: Get bulk pricing data files in multiple formats (CSV, JSON) for historical pricing analysis\\n\\n    2. Example Discovery Flow:\\n       ```\\n       # Get all service codes to find the one you need\\n       service_codes = get_pricing_service_codes()\\n\\n       # Get available attributes for filtering EC2 pricing\\n       attributes = get_pricing_service_attributes('AmazonEC2')\\n\\n       # Get all possible instance types for EC2\\n       instance_types = get_pricing_attribute_values('AmazonEC2', 'instanceType')\\n\\n       # Get pricing for specific instance types in a region\\n       filters = [{\\\"Field\\\": \\\"instanceType\\\", \\\"Value\\\": \\\"t3.medium\\\", \\\"Type\\\": \\\"TERM_MATCH\\\"}]\\n       pricing = get_pricing('AmazonEC2', 'us-east-1', filters)\\n\\n       # Get bulk pricing data files for historical analysis\\n       price_list = get_price_list_urls('AmazonEC2', 'us-east-1')\\n       # Returns: {'arn': '...', 'urls': {'csv': 'https://...', 'json': 'https://...'}}\\n       ```\\n\\n    # USE CASE 2: COST ANALYSIS REPORT GENERATION\\n    Generate comprehensive cost reports for AWS services by following these steps:\\n\\n    1. Data Gathering: Invoke get_pricing() to fetch data via AWS Pricing API\\n\\n    2. Service-Specific Analysis:\\n       - For Bedrock Services: MUST also use get_bedrock_patterns()\\n       - This provides critical architecture patterns, component relationships, and cost considerations\\n       - Especially important for Knowledge Base, Agent, Guardrails, and Data Automation services\\n\\n    3. Report Generation:\\n       - MUST generate cost analysis report using retrieved data via generate_cost_report()\\n       - The report includes sections for:\\n         * Service Overview\\n         * Architecture Pattern (for Bedrock services)\\n         * Assumptions\\n         * Limitations and Exclusions\\n         * Cost Breakdown\\n         * Cost Scaling with Usage\\n         * AWS Well-Architected Cost Optimization Recommendations\\n\\n    4. Output:\\n       Return to user:\\n       - Detailed cost analysis report in markdown format\\n       - Source of the data (web scraping, API, or websearch)\\n       - List of attempted data retrieval methods\\n\\n    ACCURACY GUIDELINES:\\n    - When uncertain about service compatibility or pricing details, EXCLUDE them rather than making assumptions\\n    - For database compatibility, only include CONFIRMED supported databases\\n    - For model comparisons, always use the LATEST models rather than specific named ones\\n    - Add clear disclaimers about what is NOT included in calculations\\n    - PROVIDING LESS INFORMATION IS BETTER THAN GIVING WRONG INFORMATION\\n    - For Bedrock Knowledge Base, ALWAYS account for OpenSearch Serverless minimum OCU requirements (2 OCUs, $345.60/month minimum)\\n    - For Bedrock Agent, DO NOT double-count foundation model costs (they're included in agent usage)\\n\\n    IMPORTANT: For report generation, steps MUST be executed in the exact order specified. Each step must be attempted\\n    before moving to the next fallback mechanism. The report is particularly focused on\\n    serverless services and pay-as-you-go pricing models.\"}}\n"

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this module, we'll explore how to implement observability for [Strands Agent](https://strandsagents.com/latest/) using [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/). Strands Agent enables you to build an intelligent AWS assistant by connecting foundation models to AWS services and resources, here's the link to [Strands Agent SDK's GitHub repo](https://github.com/strands-agents). While powerful AI agents can solve complex problems, understanding their behavior and performance requires robust observability solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Langfuse integration provides comprehensive visibility into your agent's operations, helping you monitor, debug, and optimize its performance. This module will guide you through implementing and leveraging Langfuse observability with Strands Agent to create more reliable, transparent, and effective AI solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you will learn from this module:\n",
    "1. Setup Lanfuse Observability \n",
    "2. Create a Strands Agent with [built-in tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/example-tools-package/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",
    "3. Create a Strands Agent with [custom tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/python-tools/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this module, we'll explore how to implement observability for [Strands Agent](https://strandsagents.com/latest/) using [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/). Strands Agent enables you to build an intelligent AWS assistant by connecting foundation models to AWS services and resources, here's the link to [Strands Agent SDK's GitHub repo](https://github.com/strands-agents). While powerful AI agents can solve complex problems, understanding their behavior and performance requires robust observability solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Langfuse integration provides comprehensive visibility into your agent's operations, helping you monitor, debug, and optimize its performance. This module will guide you through implementing and leveraging Langfuse observability with Strands Agent to create more reliable, transparent, and effective AI solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you will learn from this module:\n",
    "1. Setup Lanfuse Observability \n",
    "2. Create a Strands Agent with [built-in tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/example-tools-package/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",
    "3. Create a Strands Agent with [custom tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/python-tools/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",
    "4. Lastly create a Strands Agent with [MCP tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/mcp-tools/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this module, we'll explore how to implement observability for [Strands Agent](https://strandsagents.com/latest/) using [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/). Strands Agent enables you to build an intelligent AWS assistant by connecting foundation models to AWS services and resources, here's the link to [Strands Agent SDK's GitHub repo](https://github.com/strands-agents). While powerful AI agents can solve complex problems, understanding their behavior and performance requires robust observability solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Langfuse integration provides comprehensive visibility into your agent's operations, helping you monitor, debug, and optimize its performance. This module will guide you through implementing and leveraging Langfuse observability with Strands Agent to create more reliable, transparent, and effective AI solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you will learn from this module:\n",
    "1. Setup Lanfuse Observability \n",
    "2. Create a Strands Agent with [built-in tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/example-tools-package/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",
    "3. Create a Strands Agent with [custom tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/python-tools/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",
    "4. Lastly create a Strands Agent with [MCP tools](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/user-guide/concepts/tools/mcp-tools/) and trace it with Lanfuse\n",

    "tool integration approaches with comprehensive tracing capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "We successfully implemented built-in tools using the `image_reader` for AWS architecture analysis, created custom tools like the \n",
    "`aws_health_status_checker` for real-time service monitoring, and integrated `MCP (Model Context Protocol)` tools combining AWS Documentation and Pricing servers for complex multi-tool workflows. The key achievement was establishing complete observability through OpenTelemetry integration with StrandsTelemetry, enabling real-time monitoring of agent decision-making processes, tool usage patterns, and performance metrics in the Langfuse console. \n",
